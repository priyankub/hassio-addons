# Home Assistant Add-ons

Add-ons for Home Assistant allow you to extend the functionality
around your Home Assistant setup. These add-ons can consist of an application
that Home Assistant can integrate with (e.g., a [MQTT broker](/mosquitto/README.md) or [database server](/mariadb/README.md))
or allow access to your Home Assistant configuration (e.g., via [Samba](/samba/README.md) or using
the [File Editor](/configurator/README.md)).

Add-ons can be installed and configured via the Home Assistant frontend on
systems that have installed Home Assistant.
